# The-Helsinki-Puzzle

- Given a square grid of size N, where the horizontal rows are numbered 1 to N from
top to bottom and the vertical columns are numbered 1 to N from left to right.
You must place a number in each cell of the N by N grid **such that :-**
  1. Each row is unique.
  2. Each row is exactly equal to one of the columns, however, it must not be
  the column with the same index as the row.
  3. If X is the largest number you place in the grid, then you must also place
  1,2,...,X-1, where the condition X <= N is satisfied.
